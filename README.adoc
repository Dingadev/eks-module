== Features

* Deploy a fully-managed control plane
* Deploy worker nodes in an Auto Scaling Group or using Managed Node Groups
* Deploy Pods using Fargate instead of managing worker groups
* Zero-downtime, rolling deployment for updating worker nodes
* IAM to RBAC mapping
* Auto scaling and auto healing
* Fine-grained IAM roles for Pods
* Deploy Helm securely with automated TLS certificate management
* Heterogeneous worker groups that use different instance configurations (e.g AMIs, instance types, security groups, etc).
* ALB ingress controller support
* VPC tagging
* External DNS integration with Route 53




== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library], a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]!

=== Core concepts

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#core_concepts[Kubernetes and EKS core concepts]: learn about Kubernetes architecture (control plane, worker nodes), access control (authentication, authorization), resources (pods, controllers, services, config, secrets), and more.
* _https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action[Kubernetes in Action]_: the best book we've found for getting up and running with Kubernetes.


=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.

=== Gruntwork analysis

* link:/core-concepts.md#[ECS vs EKS]: A detailed comparison of EKS with ECS, two Docker orchestration tools available
  on AWS.
* link:/modules/eks-cluster-managed-workers/README.md#differences-with-self-managed-workers[Tradeoffs between Managed Node Groups and Self-Managed ASGs]:
  An overview of the tradeoffs to consider when picking your worker pools.


== Deploy

=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)

If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

* link:/examples[examples folder]: The `examples` folder contains sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not production usage).

=== Production deployment

If you want to deploy this repo in production, check out the following resources:

* https://gruntwork.io/guides/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-production-grade-kubernetes-cluster-aws/#deployment_walkthrough[How to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS]: A step-by-step guide for deploying a production-grade EKS cluster on AWS using the code in this repo.
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/tree/master/services/eks-cluster[eks-cluster in the Acme example Reference Architecture]: Production-ready sample code from the Acme Reference Architecture examples.
