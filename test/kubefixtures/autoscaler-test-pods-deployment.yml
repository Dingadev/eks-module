  # We need enough replicas to trigger a scale up event. The test cluster uses t3.medium instances, which has room for 17
  # pods. Each node has 4 pods from DaemonSets, so each node has room for 13 pods. Since we have two of those, to trigger
  # a scale up event we need to deploy >26 pods, so we choose 30
